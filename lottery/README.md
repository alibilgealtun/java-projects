# Lottery
  This is basically a lottery game that you have 2 bags and 2 cards (S1 - S2). Values are randomly choosen from bag 1 and computer checks if card 1 or card 2 has it in them. There are also scores, the winner is decided by scores and game ends when a card has no value.
  You can check the pdf to see what are the conditions for this project.
